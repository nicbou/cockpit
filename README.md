Cockpit
=======

A project management tool written in Python using the Django framework.

This project was a training exercise, and needs to be heavily refactored in order to follow Django's best practices. I strongly recommend that you don't use it as an example.

**Main features:**

* Create projects with deadlines, raise their priority or put them on hold.
* Upload and annotate project documents, share them with clients, and let them leave comments on them.
* Create tasks for your projects, assign them a priority.
* Write down memos for critical project information.
* See all active tasks for all project from your dashboard.

**Main priorities:**

* Sleek, consistent user interface. Anyone should be able to pick it up easily.
* Focus on flexibility. It is simple enough to fit anyone's workflow.
